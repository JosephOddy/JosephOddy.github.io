## Current research

I'm currently working on my PhD project at Rothamsted Research under the supervision of Nigel Halford, along with partners at the University of Reading and Mondelez International.

### Investigating natural diversity in the asparagine synthetase family

In collaboration with Stephen Pearce and his group at Colorado State University, we investigated a deletion of one of the wheat asparagine synthetase genes (*TaASN-B2*) and how this impacts grain asparagine content in the field. Our paper on this is available [here](https://bmcplantbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12870-021-03058-7) and corresponding R markdown is available [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/JosephOddy/TaASN-B2/blob/main/code/211228-TaASN-B2-figures.html) or on my GitHub.

### Finding stable QTL for quality traits

I'm hoping to find stable QTL for asparagine and other quality traits that can be incorporated into breeding programs. We are doing this using a soft wheat mapping population developed in collaboration with John Innes Centre and Limagrain.

### Growing low asparagine wheat

In combination with the above genetic studies, we are also trying to find optimum agronomic conditions/treatment regimes to prevent grain asparagine accumulation.
