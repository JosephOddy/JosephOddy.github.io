## Current research

I'm currently working on my PhD project at Rothamsted Research under the supervision of Nigel Halford, along with partners at the University of Reading and Mondelez International.

### Investigating natural diversity in the asparagine synthetase family

Alongside collaborators at Colorado State University, we investigated a deletion of one of the wheat asparagine synthetase genes (*TaASN-B2*) and how this impacts grain asparagine content in the field. Paper available here.

### Finding stable QTL for quality traits

I'm hoping to find stable QTL for asparagine and other quality traits that can be incorporated into breeding programs. We are doing this using a soft wheat mapping population developed in collaboration with John Innes Centre and Limagrain.

### Growing low asparagine wheat

In combination with the above genetic studies, we are also trying to find optimum agronomic conditions/treatment regimes to prevent grain asparagine accumulation.
